# Keylogger

This is a program that is made in python. Its a a program that enables the user to record his keystrokes.  I made this project purely for fun and demonstrations purpose. Anyone is free to use this as starting template for their own keylogger.

# Features
•	Timestamped keystrokes. 

•	Documents the window the keystrokes were typed in. 

•	Keystrokes are logged in a textfile and in a csv table. 

# Known Errors
•	The keystrokes will not be able to record the keystrokes if the user has the text file opened where the keystrokes are stored. The same also applies if the user has table opened where the keystrokes are stored as well. 

•	The program sometimes has to be run as admin.
